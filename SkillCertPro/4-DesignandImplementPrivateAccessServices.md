## Design and Implement Azure Private Link Service and Azure Private Endpoints

### Planning Private Endpoints

Planning is vital for effective private endpoint deployment. Here's what to consider:

* **Services:** Identify PaaS services (Storage, SQL Database) or Private Link Services you want to connect to.
* **Virtual Networks (VNets):** Determine the VNets where you'll create private endpoints for secure access.
* **Connectivity:** Decide if connections will be within the same region, across peered VNets, or use ExpressRoute/VPN for on-premises access.
* **Security:** Define access controls using Resource-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict who can access the private endpoint.

### Creating Private Endpoints

Once you have a plan, here's how to create private endpoints:

1. Access the Azure portal or Azure CLI.
2. Navigate to the desired VNet.
3. Select **Private Endpoints** under the **Networking** section.
4. Click **Create** and choose the target service or Private Link service.
5. Specify a name, resource group, and the desired subnet within the VNet.

	* Subnet selection influences outbound traffic routing.

6. Configure the private link service connection (if applicable).
7. Review and create the private endpoint.

**Note:** You can create multiple private endpoints to access different sub resources within an Azure service (e.g., separate endpoints for Azure Storage blobs and files).

### Configuring Access to Private Endpoints

Here's how to configure access to private endpoints:

1. **For Azure PaaS services:** No additional configuration is needed for authorized services.
2. **For Private Link services:** The service owner needs to approve connection requests from your private endpoint in their Private Link service configuration.

### RBAC plays a crucial role

* Assign appropriate RBAC roles to users or service identities to grant access to the private endpoint within your VNet.
* By default, public internet access to the service remains possible unless explicitly restricted on the service side.

### Creating a Private Link Service

A Private Link service acts as a wrapper for your service running behind a Standard Load Balancer. It allows authorized consumers to access your service privately using private endpoints within their VNets. Here's how to crate one:

* **Deploy a Standard Load Balancer:** This balancer distributes traffic to your service instances.
* **Enable Private Link on the Load Balancer:** This exposes your service for private access through Private Link.
* **Configure Access (Optional):** You can restrict access to specific VNets or subscriptions using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### Integrating Private Link and Private Endpoints with DNS

Private Endpoints use private IP addresses from your VNet. To simplify service discovery, you can integrate PRivate Link with DNS:

* **Create a Private DNS Zone:** This zone resides within your VNet and holds private DNS records.
* **Link the PRivate DNS Zone with the Private Link Service:** This creates a private DNS record mapping a custom domain name to the service's private endpoint.
* **Configure VM DNS Settings:** Point your VMs to use the private DNS server for resolving service names.

### Integrating a Private Link Service with On-premises Clients

Private Link inherently works within Azure. To connect on-premises clients to your PRivate Link service, you need to establish a private connection between your on-premises network and Azure:

* **ExpressRoute:** This dedicate private connection offers high bandwidth and low latency.
* **VPN Gateway:** A more cost-effective option for occasional access, but with lower performance compared to ExpressRoute.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Service Approval:** Granting access to your Private Link service requires approval for each
connection request.
* **Sub resource Access:** A single private endpoint connects to one service. If your service has
sub resources (e.g., storage accounts with blobs and files), you need separate private endpoints for each.

For comprehensive learning, refer to Microsoft's documentation:

* **Create a Private Link service:**  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-
us/training/modules/introduction-azure-private-link/
* **Integrate Azure Private Link with DNS:** There's no official documentation for this specific configuration, but you can combine the concepts from these resources:

## Design and Implement Service Endpoints

### Choosing When to Use a Service Endpoint

* **Enhanced Security:** Service endpoints restrict data traffic to the Azure internal network, reducing the attack surface and potential breaches compared to public internet access.
* **Improved Connectivity:** Traffic stays within the Azure backbone, potentially lowering latency and improving overall performance.
* **Compliance Needs:** Certain regulations might require data to remain within a specific geographic boundary. Service endpoints can help achieve such compliance.

### Creating Service Endpoints

There are several ways to create service endpoints depending on your preference:

* **Azure Portal:** Use the intuitive interface to configure service endpoints for supported Azure services.
* **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates:** Define service endpoints declaratively for infrastructure as code deployments.
* **Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI:** Leverage these command-line tools for scripting and automation purposes.

### Configuring Service Endpoint Policies

Service endpoint policies allow granular control over traffic flow. You cane define:

* **Allowed source addresses:** Specify which subnets within your virtual network can access the service endpoint.
* **Service alias:** Assign a custom DNS name within your virtual network for Azure service endpoint, simplifying resource access.

### Configuring Access to Service Endpoints

Once a service endpoint is created, resources within your virtual network can access the Azure service using the configured private IP address or service alias (if defined).  Here are some key points:

* **No Public IP Required:** Resource don't need public IP addresses to communicate with the service through the service endpoint.
* **Route Table Configuration:** Ensure proper route tables are configured to direct traffic towards the service endpoint within your virtual network.
* **DNS Resolution:** Update DNS settings within your virtual network to point to the service alias (if used) for seamless resource access.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Service endpoints are currently not supported for all Azure services. Refer to Microsoft's documentation for a comprehensive list of supported services.
* You can integrate service endpoints with Azure Private Link for even more granular access control and service discovery.
