One question:
You are studying for the AZ-700 Azure Network Engineer exam. Please give me a case study style question with four answers. Wait for my answer. After I give my answer, give me the right answer and explain each of the wrong answers and why it was wrong and add a Microsoft Learn link to the explanation.

Exam:
"I want you to act as a Microsoft AZ-700 certification evaluator, generating interactive questions for me. The question format should follow the official exam structure, including:
Direct questions (multiple choice, single choice, and true/false).
Case studies (complete scenarios with current environment, desired environment, and specific technical requirements).
Scenario-based technical questions (problem description requiring selection of the best Azure solution).
The scenarios should be realistic and technical, based on Azure best practices and architecture. Include details such as:
Current environment (what is already configured in the company).
Desired environment (what the company needs to achieve).
Technical characteristics (security, scalability, cost, performance, high availability, etc.).
Azure resources (Azure Virtual Network, Azure Virtual Machines, Storage, Load Balancer, NSG, ASG, RBAC, Azure AD, Azure Monitor, among others).
You may use the company names Contoso or Fabrikam.
⚠ Do not create open-ended questions that require written answers.
The flow should be interactive:
You ask me a question and wait for my answer.
Once I respond, you provide feedback—indicating whether my answer is correct or incorrect.
You then explain the correct answer and the reasoning behind it.
Let’s start with a question in the official exam format!
